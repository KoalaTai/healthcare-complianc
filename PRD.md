## Design Direction
Professional, clean interface that conveys technical expertise while remaining approachable - should feel like a premium enterprise planning tool with subtle modern touches and excellent information hierarchy.

## Color Selection
Complementary (opposite colors) - Deep professional blue paired with warm orange accents to create trust and energy.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Professional Blue (oklch(0.25 0.15 240)) - Conveys trust, stability, and technical expertise
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays (oklch(0.95 0.01 240)) for backgrounds and subtle elements
- **Accent Color**: Warm Orange (oklch(0.65 0.15 45)) - Draws attention to CTAs and important status indicators
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Light Gray): Dark Blue text (oklch(0.2 0.12 240)) - Ratio 14.2:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 12.8:1 ✓
  - Accent (Warm Orange): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should convey technical precision and professional credibility while maintaining excellent readability for detailed documentation.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Titles): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Subsections): Inter Medium/20px/normal spacing
  - Body Text: Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Code/Technical: JetBrains Mono/14px/monospace for technical content

## Animations
Subtle, purposeful animations that enhance professional feel without distracting from content - animations should feel precise and intentional like quality enterprise software.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth transitions convey polish and attention to detail expected in enterprise tools
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary focus on content loading states and navigation transitions, minimal decorative animation

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Card-based layouts for project sections, Table for requirements/risks, Tabs for navigation, Dialog for detailed views, Button variants for different action types
- **Customizations**: Custom architecture diagram component, enhanced file tree visualization, progress tracking indicators
- **States**: Clear loading states for document generation, hover effects for interactive elements, active states for navigation
- **Icon Selection**: Professional icons from Phosphor (Folder, FileText, Diagram, Shield, CheckCircle) representing project artifacts
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4-unit spacing scale (16px, 24px, 32px) with generous whitespace for professional appearance
- **Mobile**: Responsive card stacking, collapsible navigation, touch-optimized interactive elements with progressive disclosure
