**Document:** STRAT-REG-EXP-001  
**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Classification:** Internal Use  

## Executive Summary

VirtualBackroom.ai V2.0 requires an extensive, continuously updated library of regulatory standards to provide comprehensive compliance analysis across multiple industries and jurisdictions. This strategy outlines the systematic expansion of our regulatory knowledge base from the current 47 standards to 200+ standards over 24 months, with particular focus on AI-analyzable content and global coverage.

## Current State Analysis
