- Date: 2024
- Owner: Cybersecurity & Compliance Lead
- Review Cycle: Annual

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This cybersecurity plan establishes the security controls and implementation requirements for VirtualBackroom.ai V2.0, a Software as Medical Device (SaMD) platform for regulatory compliance analysis. The plan aligns with NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001, HIPAA Security Rule, and 21 CFR Part 11 requirements.

## 2. Security Architecture Overview

### 2.1 AWS Cloud-Native Security Model
The V2.0 architecture leverages AWS managed services to implement defense-in-depth security:

- **Identity Layer**: AWS Cognito User Pools for authentication and authorization
- **Network Layer**: VPC with private subnets, security groups, and NACLs
- **Application Layer**: ECS Fargate with container-level isolation
- **Data Layer**: Encrypted RDS PostgreSQL and S3 with KMS encryption
- **API Layer**: AWS API Gateway with rate limiting and WAF protection

### 2.2 Multi-Tenant Security Model
- **Tenant Isolation**: Application-level tenant ID enforcement in all database queries
- **Resource Segregation**: Logical separation using PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Cross-Tenant Prevention**: API middleware validates tenant context on every request

## 3. Access Control Framework

### 3.1 Identity and Access Management (IAM)

#### AWS IAM Roles and Policies
- **ECS Task Role**: Minimal permissions for application execution
  - S3 bucket access (scoped to tenant-specific prefixes)
  - RDS connection permissions
  - CloudWatch logging permissions
- **Lambda Execution Role**: Background processing permissions
  - SQS queue read/write
  - S3 object read/write
  - OpenAI API call permissions (via secrets manager)
- **Administrative Roles**: Separate roles for DevOps, Security, and Compliance teams

#### User Authentication via AWS Cognito
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all users
- **Password Policy**: 
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
  - Password history enforcement (last 12 passwords)
  - Maximum age: 90 days
- **Session Management**: 
  - JWT token expiry: 8 hours
  - Refresh token rotation enabled
  - Concurrent session limits: 3 per user

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Organization Admin**: Full tenant management, user invitation, billing
- **Quality Manager**: Document upload, analysis review, report export
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to analyses and reports
- **System Admin**: Cross-tenant administrative functions (limited to platform operators)

### 3.2 Principle of Least Privilege
- **Service Accounts**: Each AWS service uses dedicated IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- **User Permissions**: Default role assignment is "Viewer" with explicit elevation required
- **API Access**: Scoped permissions per endpoint based on user role and tenant context

## 4. Data Protection Controls
