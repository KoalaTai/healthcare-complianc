# Cybersecurity Plan v2.0 - VirtualBackroom.ai

## Executive Summary

This cybersecurity plan establishes comprehensive security controls for VirtualBackroom.ai V2.0, ensuring protection of sensitive regulatory documents and compliance with enterprise security requirements including SOC 2, HIPAA, and GDPR.

## Security Architecture Overview

### Identity & Access Management

#### Enterprise SSO Integration
- **Primary Providers**: Microsoft 365 (Azure AD), Google Workspace, SAML 2.0
- **Implementation**: OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect with PKCE for web applications
- **Fallback**: Enterprise-grade identity providers (Okta, Auth0) for organizations requiring additional IdP options
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens with 8-hour expiration, refresh token rotation
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enforced through enterprise IdP policies

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Organization Admin**: Full organization management, user provisioning
- **Quality Manager**: Document analysis, report generation, audit trail access
- **Analyst**: Document upload, view own analyses
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to shared reports

#### Service-to-Service Authentication
- **AWS IAM Roles**: Least privilege principle for all service interactions
- **Service Accounts**: Dedicated IAM roles for ECS tasks, Lambda functions
- **Cross-Service Communication**: mTLS for internal service communication

### Data Protection Controls

#### Encryption at Rest
- **Database**: PostgreSQL RDS with encryption enabled using AWS KMS customer-managed keys
- **Document Storage**: S3 with SSE-KMS encryption, separate KMS keys per organization
- **Backup Storage**: Encrypted snapshots with 35-day retention policy
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS with automated key rotation (annual)

#### Encryption in Transit
- **External Communication**: TLS 1.3 minimum for all client connections
- **Internal Communication**: TLS 1.2 minimum for service-to-service communication
- **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway with custom domain and SSL certificate
- **Certificate Management**: AWS Certificate Manager with automated renewal

#### Data Loss Prevention
- **Document Access Logging**: All document access events logged with user attribution
- **Download Restrictions**: Time-limited, authenticated download URLs for reports
- **Data Residency**: Customer data stored in customer-specified AWS regions
- **Right to Deletion**: Automated data deletion workflows for GDPR compliance

### Network Security

#### Network Segmentation
- **VPC Configuration**: Isolated VPC with public/private subnet architecture
- **Security Groups**: Restrictive ingress/egress rules following least privilege
- **NACLs**: Additional network-level access controls for sensitive subnets
- **NAT Gateways**: Managed egress for private subnet resources

#### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: AWS API Gateway throttling (10,000 requests/minute per user)
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic models for all API request/response validation
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries
- **CORS Policy**: Restrictive CORS headers limiting origin domains

### Monitoring & Incident Response

#### Security Monitoring
- **AWS CloudTrail**: All API calls logged and monitored
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Application logs, metrics, and alerting
- **Security Events**: Automated alerts for:
  - Failed authentication attempts (>5 in 5 minutes)
  - Unusual access patterns
  - Privilege escalation attempts
  - Data export activities

#### Incident Response
- **24/7 Monitoring**: Automated alerting to on-call engineering team
- **Response SLA**: Initial response within 1 hour for security incidents
- **Escalation Matrix**: Defined escalation paths for different incident severities
- **Forensic Logging**: 90-day retention of detailed security logs

### Vulnerability Management

#### Dependency Scanning
- **Automated Scanning**: GitHub Dependabot for dependency vulnerabilities
- **Container Scanning**: AWS ECR vulnerability scanning for Docker images
- **Patch Management**: Automated security updates for non-breaking changes
- **Vulnerability SLA**: Critical vulnerabilities patched within 24 hours

#### Security Testing
- **Static Analysis**: SonarQube integration in CI/CD pipeline
- **Dynamic Testing**: Automated security testing in staging environment
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party penetration testing
- **Bug Bounty**: Responsible disclosure program for security researchers
