## 1. Protocol Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This protocol establishes the validation approach for VirtualBackroom.ai's AI-powered regulatory compliance document analysis engine, ensuring the system meets accuracy, reliability, and performance requirements for production use.

### 1.2 Scope
This validation covers:
- OpenAI GPT-4 model integration for document analysis
- Custom prompt engineering and response processing
- Analysis accuracy across multiple regulatory frameworks
- System performance under various load conditions
- Error handling and edge case management

### 1.3 Regulatory Context
This validation protocol supports compliance with:

- **Medium Risk (R-001)**: System Performance - Load testing validation

## 2. Validation Strategy

### 2.1 V-Model Validation Approach
The validation follows the V-Model methodology with requirements traceability:

```
User Requirements (Epic 1-3) ←→ User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
         ↓                              ↑
Functional Requirements     ←→    System Integration Testing
         ↓                              ↑
System Architecture        ←→    Component Integration Testing
         ↓                              ↑
Detailed Design           ←→    Unit Testing
```
